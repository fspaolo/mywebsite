# Who is Fernando?

I'm Fernando Paolo, a Machine Learning Engineer at [Global Fishing Watch](https://globalfishingwatch.org/about-us/)'s research division. I develop algorithms for global analysis of remote-sensing data (satellite AIS, SAR and optical imagery), and use (deep) artificial neural networks to reveal human activity at sea and related impact to the environment.

Before that, I worked at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, studying the role of the Cryosphere in the Earth's climate system and its implication on future sea-level change. I used high-performance computing to process and analyze three decades of radar and laser satellite measurements over the Earth's ice sheets.

Before that, I got my PhD in Geophysics from the University of California, San Diego, where I developed statistical methods for satellite data fusion and change detection to study ice-ocean-atmosphere interactions.

Before that, I got my MS in Geophysics working with space geodesy, combining spaceborne and shipborne measurements to improve the derivation of the Earth's gravity field using inverse methods.

Before that, I got interested in climate science during my undergraduate years while taking part in an Antarctic expedition for over a month. I studied Oceanography at the University of Sao Paulo, Brazil, participating in several scientific cruises to the South Atlantic Ocean.

## Professional Biosketch

Fernando develops ML algorithms for global analysis of satellite data to study human activity at sea. Before joining Global Fishing Watch, he worked as a postdoctoral scholar at NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Caltech, where he used radar and laser satellite measurements to quantify current ice sheet loss and global sea level change, while also assisting with the data engineering of NASA’s ICESat-2 mission. In 2015 he received the NASA Most Valuable Player Award for Cryospheric Sciences. Fernando obtained his PhD in Geophysics from the University of California, San Diego, and has authored numerous articles on climate research using statistical/ML methods. He has also participated in several scientific cruises to the Southern Ocean, including an Antarctic expedition. Fernando is a strong advocate of open source and open data.


## Why a minimal design?

In a visually striking and polluted world, a minimalistic layout recovers the beauty of simplicity and sophistication. The aesthetics of modern design is clean and focuses on the contents' essential, reducing the subject to its fundamental features, and nothing more...

> In anything at all, perfection is finally attained not when there is no longer anything to add, but when there is no longer anything to take away, when a body has been stripped down to its nakedness. -Antoine de Saint Exupéry

> The public is more familiar with bad design than good design. It is, in effect, conditioned to prefer bad design, because that is what it lives with. The new becomes threatening, the old reassuring.  -Paul Rand
