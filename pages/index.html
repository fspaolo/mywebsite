<h1>I investigate how human use of the ocean is changing. I map human activities at sea using petabytes of satellite data and deep neural networks to build a picture of what is being done in the ocean, where and by whom_</h2>

<p>Truth is not what you want it to be, it is what it is. And you must bend to its power or live a lie. /Musashi</p>
