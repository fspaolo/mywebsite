## Our paper in Science

Media coverage of our [*Science*](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/04/29/science.aaz5845) paper on pervasive ice sheet loss from NASA's satellite laser mission.

> “With the unprecedented accuracy and precision of this novel measurement system, we are now able to detect the small signals far into the ice sheet interior, as well as map out the changes over narrow glaciers on high-slope terrain around the ice sheets,” said study coauthor Fernando S. Paolo of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. “Previous altimeters struggled with these challenges. Because we used laser measurements over a fairly long time span (about 16 years), we are getting the overall trends of ice sheet mass loss with higher confidence.”

## On the role of natural climate variability

> Finally, [Paolo et al. (2018)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-017-0033-0) showed that the influence of El Niño events on West Antarctic glaciers could be measured by satellite observations: El Niño events tend to be correlated with both increased melting from below, and increased snowfall above, and the variations in the altitude of the ice sheet surface (varying by a few tens of cm) can be detected by satellite altimetry.

## Comment on Nature Geoscience paper

> “Field observations of this kind are scarce and extremely valuable,” said Fernando Paolo, a polar scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., not involved in the research. “The study reaffirms the importance of looking at polynyas to better understand mass exchanges between the ice shelves and the ocean.”

## Comment on PNAS paper

> "We have known from observations that the ice sheets and mountain glaciers have been losing mass at an accelerated rate over the past decade or so," Fernando Paolo, postdoctoral scholar at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, who was not involved with the study, told Newsweek. This study shows "a clear acceleration in the 25-year sea level rise, which can be linked to the accelerated ice loss."

## Our paper in Nature Geoscience

Media coverage of our [*Nature Geoscience*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-017-0033-0) paper about the impact of El Nino and La Nina on West Antarctic ice shelves

> "That means for a short period of time you are adding the two together [gains from snowfall and loses from melting]. And that's key information to put into computer models if you want to properly represent the dynamics of these systems," explained Dr Paolo, who has now moved to the US space agency.

## Comment on Science Advances paper

> “We have little data on the ocean and ice shelf conditions in this region,” says Fernando Paolo, a geophysicist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.  But the 14-year record used in the study is still somewhat short to infer a definitive link between wind-driven upwelling and ice shelf melt, he says. Still, he adds, these new data are a welcome addition to the pool of sparse observations, supporting the idea that Totten Glacier is very sensitive to changing oceanic conditions, much like the fast-thinning glaciers in West Antarctica.
