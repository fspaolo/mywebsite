## Media coverage on papers

**BBC:** [How AI is being used to prevent illegal fishing](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68564249)

""We use information like the length of the vessel, plus environmental information as to where that vessel is located, the imaging of the area, the density of vessel traffic in the area, the state of the ocean, like the temperature - a bunch of information on where the vessel is operating," says Fernando Paolo, Global Fishing Watch's senior remote sensing machine learning engineer."

> “With the unprecedented accuracy and precision of this novel measurement system, we are now able to detect the small signals far into the ice sheet interior, as well as map out the changes over narrow glaciers on high-slope terrain around the ice sheets,” said study coauthor Fernando S. Paolo of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. “Previous altimeters struggled with these challenges. Because we used laser measurements over a fairly long time span (about 16 years), we are getting the overall trends of ice sheet mass loss with higher confidence.”

**IPCC Report:** [Cited multiple times on Chapters 3 and 4 in
the United Nations's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change](https://www.ipcc.ch/srocc/)

> There is high confidence that the input of ice shelf meltwater has
increased in the Amundsen and Bellingshausen Seas since the 1990s,
but low confidence in trends in other sectors (Paolo et al., 2015).

> Reduction or loss of ice shelf buttressing has dominated Antarctic Ice
Sheet dynamic thinning (high confidence) ...  ice shelf thinning
increased in WAIS by 70% in the decade to 2012, averaged  8%
thickness loss from 1994 to 2012 in the Amundsen Sea Embayment
(Paolo et al., 2015).

> Recent ENSO variability is correlated with recent changes in ice 
shelf thickness (Paolo et al., 2018).

> They lose mass through a combination of calving and by melting 
from below, especially where basal ice is in contact with warm water 
(Paolo et al., 2015; others)

> It has become increasingly evident that this ice loss is being 
driven by sub-ice oceanic melt (thinning) of ice shelves 
(Paolo et al., 2015; others)

> Finally, Paolo et al. (2018) showed that the influence of El Niño events on West Antarctic glaciers could be measured by satellite observations: El Niño events tend to be correlated with both increased melting from below, and increased snowfall above, and the variations in the altitude of the ice sheet surface (varying by a few tens of cm) can be detected by satellite altimetry.

**Eos:** [Warm Water Is Rapidly Eroding Antarctica’s Ross Ice Shelf](https://doi.org/10.1029/2019EO123031)

> “Field observations of this kind are scarce and extremely valuable,” said Fernando Paolo, a polar scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., not involved in the research. “The study reaffirms the importance of looking at polynyas to better understand mass exchanges between the ice shelves and the ocean.”

> "We have known from observations that the ice sheets and mountain glaciers have been losing mass at an accelerated rate over the past decade or so," Fernando Paolo, postdoctoral scholar at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, who was not involved with the study, told Newsweek. This study shows "a clear acceleration in the 25-year sea level rise, which can be linked to the accelerated ice loss."

**ScienceNews:** [Wind may be driving the melting of East Antarctica’s largest glacier](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/wind-may-be-driving-melting-east-antarctica-totten-glacier)

> “We have little data on the ocean and ice shelf conditions in this region,” says Fernando Paolo, a geophysicist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.  But the 14-year record used in the study is still somewhat short to infer a definitive link between wind-driven upwelling and ice shelf melt, he says. Still, he adds, these new data are a welcome addition to the pool of sparse observations, supporting the idea that Totten Glacier is very sensitive to changing oceanic conditions, much like the fast-thinning glaciers in West Antarctica.
