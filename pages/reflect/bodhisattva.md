# The way of the Bodhisattva

May I be a guard for those who need protection  

A guide for those on the path  

A boat, a raft, a bridge for those who wish to cross the flood  

May I be a lamp in the darkness  

A resting place for the weary  

A healing medicine for all who are sick  

A vase of plenty, a tree of miracles  

And for the boundless multitudes of living beings  

May I bring sustenance and awakening  

Enduring like the earth and sky  

Until all beings are freed from sorrow  

And all are awakened.  

-[Shantideva, sixth-century?](https://jackkornfield.com/the-bodhisattvas-path/)
