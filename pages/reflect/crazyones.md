# To the crazy ones 

Here's to the crazy ones  

The misfits  

The rebels  

The troublemakers  

The round pegs in the square holes  

The ones who see things differently  

They're not fond of rules  

And they have no respect for the status quo  

You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them  

About the only thing you can't do is ignore them  

Because they change things  

They push the human race forward  

While some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius  

Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do.
