# The path of aloneness

Musashi, A Ronin in Japan from 1584 to 1645, developed a philosofy of self reliance, inner calm, acceptance, and discipline.

“There is nothing outside of yourself that can ever enable you to get better, stronger, richer, quicker, or smarter. Everything is within. Everything exists. Seek nothing outside of yourself.”

-[Miyamoto Musashi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miyamoto_Musashi)
