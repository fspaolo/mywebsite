# I set my hearth on learning

At fifteen, I set my heart on learning.

At thirty, I was firmly established.

At forty, I had no more doubts.

At fifty, I knew the will of heaven.

At sixty, I was ready to listen to it.

At seventy, I could follow my heart's desire without transgressing what was right.

(alternative translation)

When I was fifteen I set my heart on learning.

At thirty I took my stand.

At forty I was without confusion.

At fifty I knew the command of Tian.

At sixty I heard it with a compliant ear.

At seventy I follow the desires of my heart and do not overstep the bounds.
