# The Laughing Heart

> Your life is your life

> Don’t let it be clubbed into dank submission.

> Be on the watch.

> There are ways out.

> There is a light somewhere.

> It may not be much light but

> It beats the darkness.

> Be on the watch.

> The gods will offer you chances.

> Know them.

> Take them.

> You can’t beat death but

> You can beat death in life, sometimes.

> And the more often you learn to do it,

> The more light there will be.

> Your life is your life.

> Know it while you have it.

> You are marvelous

> The gods wait to delight

> In you.

-[Charles Bukowski](https://blog.bestamericanpoetry.com/the_best_american_poetry/2011/09/bukowski.html)
