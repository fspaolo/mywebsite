Short bio I first became interested in polar research during my undergraduate years while participating in an expedition to Antarctica for over a month. Seeking a multidisciplinary Earth Science education I studied Oceanography at the University of Sao Paulo, Brazil, where I had the opportunity to participate in several scientific cruises in the South Atlantic Ocean. During my Masters in Geophysics I gained experience in space geodesy, combining satellite altimetry and shipborne measurements to improve the derivation of the Earth&amp;rsquo;s gravity field using an inverse approach.</description>
