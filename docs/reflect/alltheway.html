		<div class="content"><h1>Go all the way</h1>
<p>If you’re going to try, go all the way.</p>
<p>Otherwise, don’t even start.</p>
<p>This could mean losing girlfriends, wives, relatives and maybe even your mind.</p>
<p>It could mean not eating for three or four days.</p>
<p>It could mean freezing on a park bench.</p>
<p>It could mean jail.</p>
<p>It could mean derision.</p>
<p>It could mean mockery — isolation.</p>
<p>Isolation is the gift.</p>
<p>All the others are a test of your endurance, of how much you really want to do it.</p>
<p>And, you’ll do it, despite rejection and the worst odds.</p>
<p>And it will be better than anything else you can imagine.</p>
<p>If you’re going to try, go all the way.</p>
<p>There is no other feeling like that.</p>
<p>You will be alone with the gods, and the nights will flame with fire.</p>
<p>You will ride life straight to perfect laughter.</p>
<p>It’s the only good fight there is.</p>
