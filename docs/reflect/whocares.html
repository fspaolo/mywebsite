<p>First they came for the Communists, and I did not speak out</p>
<p>Because I was not a Communist.</p>
<p>Then they came for the Trade Unionists, and I did not speak out</p>
<p>Because I was not a Trade Unionist.</p>
<p>Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out</p>
<p>Because I was not a Jew.</p>
<p>Then they came for me</p>
<p>and there was no one left to speak for me.</p>
