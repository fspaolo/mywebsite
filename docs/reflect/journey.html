<p>Wisdom is understanding that you don't have to hold your happiness hostage until some future time where your desires get gratified, but that doesn't mean it's irrational to plan for the future. Whatever your goals, the quality of the journey has to become more important than those fleeting moments when you actually arrive at your destination, as most of your life is the journey.</p>
