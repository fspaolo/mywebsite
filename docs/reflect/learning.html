<p>At fifteen, I set my heart on learning.</p>
<p>At thirty, I was firmly established.</p>
<p>At forty, I had no more doubts.</p>
<p>At fifty, I knew the will of heaven.</p>
<p>At sixty, I was ready to listen to it.</p>
<p>At seventy, I could follow my heart's desire without transgressing what was right.</p>
<p>(alternative translation)</p>
<p>When I was fifteen I set my heart on learning.</p>
<p>At thirty I took my stand.</p>
<p>At forty I was without confusion.</p>
<p>At fifty I knew the command of Tian.</p>
<p>At sixty I heard it with a compliant ear.</p>
<p>At seventy I follow the desires of my heart and do not overstep the bounds.</p>
