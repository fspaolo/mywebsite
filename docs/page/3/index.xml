      <description>First they came for the Communists, and I did not speak out—
&amp;nbsp;
Because I was not a Communist.
&amp;nbsp;
Then they came for the Trade Unionists, and I did not speak out—
&amp;nbsp;
Because I was not a Trade Unionist.
&amp;nbsp;
Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out—
&amp;nbsp;
Because I was not a Jew.
&amp;nbsp;
Then they came for me—
&amp;nbsp;
and there was no one left to speak for me.</description>
