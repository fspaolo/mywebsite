    <p>Interannual and decadal variations of Antarctic ice shelves using multi-mission satellite radar altimetry, and links with oceanic and atmospheric forcings Abstract. Antarctica&rsquo;s ice shelves, the floating extensions of the ice sheet, exert an important dynamic constraint on the flow of ice from the grounded ice sheet to the ocean, and hence on changes in global sea level. Thinning of an ice shelf reduces its ability to restrain the ice discharge from the grounded ice-sheet interior.</p>

    <p>— What would you think it&rsquo;s worth telling future generations about the life you&rsquo;ve lived and the lessons you&rsquo;ve learned from it?
 I should like to say two things, one intellectual and one moral. The intellectual thing I should want to say is this: When you are studying any matter, or considering any philosophy, ask yourself only what are the facts and what is the truth that the facts bear out.</p>

    <a href="http://fspaolo.net/think/states/">Seven signs of non-competitive states</a>
  </h2>
  <time>1. January, 0001</time>
  <article>
    <p>Traditional indicators of noncompetitive performance still apply: corruption (the most seductive activity humans can consummate while clothed); the absence of sound, equitably enforced laws; civil strife; or government attempts to overmanage a national economy. As change has internationalized and accelerated, however, new predictive tools have emerged. They are as simple as they are fundamental, and they are rooted in culture. The greater the degree to which a state &mdash; or an entire civilization &mdash; succumbs to these &ldquo;seven deadly sins&rdquo; of collective behavior, the more likely that entity is to fail to progress or even to maintain its position in the struggle for a share of the world&rsquo;s wealth and power.</p>

  <article>
    <p>Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.
&mdash; Antoine de saint-exupéry
Plurality should not be assumed without necessity.
&mdash; William of Ockham (Ockham’s Razor)
Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler.
&mdash; Albert Einstein
The ability to simplify means to eliminate the unnecessary so that the necessary may speak.
&mdash; Hans Hofmann</p>

  </h2>
  <time>1. January, 0001</time>
  <article>
    <p>No society wants you to become wise: it is against the investment of all societies. If people are wise, they cannot be exploited. If they are intelligent, they cannot be subjugated, they cannot be forced into a mechanical life, to live like robots. They will assert themselves &mdash; they will assert their individuality. They will have the fragrance of rebellion around them; they will want to live in freedom.</p>
