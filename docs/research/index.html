<p>I study how human activities impact the global ocean and the Earth's climate. I develop machine learning algorithms to analyze petabytes of satellite data (imagery, altimetry, AIS) and search for patterns of change in the physical world. I am a strong advocate of open source and open data!</p>

<p><strong>Ice shelf melting:</strong> Widespread slowdown in thinning rates of West Antarctic ice shelves.</p>
<p>Antarctica's floating ice shelves modulate discharge of grounded ice into the ocean by providing a backstress. Ice shelf thinning and grounding line retreat have reduced this backstress, driving rapid drawdown of key unstable areas of the Antarctic Ice Sheet, leading to sea-level rise. If ice shelf loss continues, it may initiate irreversible glacier retreat. We used 26 years (1992–2017) of satellite-derived Antarctic ice shelf thickness, flow, and basal melt rates to construct a time-dependent dataset of ice shelf thickness and basal melt. Our data revealed an overall pattern of thinning all around Antarctica. <a href="https://tc.copernicus.org/articles/17/3409/2023/tc-17-3409-2023.html">Checkout the paper</a></p>

<p><strong>Fighting illegal fishing:</strong> Detecting Dark Fishing Activity Using
Synthetic Aperture Radar Imagery and ML.</p>
<p>Unsustainable fishing practices worldwide pose a major threat to marine resources
and ecosystems. Identifying vessels that do not show up in conventional monitoring systems—known as “dark vessels”—is key to managing and securing the health
of marine environments. With the rise of satellite-based synthetic aperture radar
(SAR) imaging and modern machine learning (ML), it is now possible to automate
detection of dark vessels day or night, under all-weather conditions. <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=PfyWdxM-S4N">Checkout the paper</a></p>

<p>Powered by petabytes of satellite data and machine learning, the first ever global map of previously undetected dark fleets is now available for free to anyone in the world with an internet connection, helping arm authorities, researchers and the public alike with the power to monitor vessel activity in all coastal waters, identify dark fleet patterns and build the necessary understanding to quantify threats to the ocean. <a href="https://tinyurl.com/4hcfcu4n">See interactive map</a></p>

<p><strong>Global vessel traffic:</strong> Billions of vessel positions from satellite AIS analyzed to reveal global traffic patterns.</p>
<p>Every day we download and process more than 20 million data points from satellite AIS, giving us the positions of hundreds of thousands of vessels in the world. This map shows all vessels carrying AIS, fishing and non-fishing, and is created from billions of GPS coordinates. You can see the shipping lanes crisis across the globe, and the hotspots (bright areas) along the coast with excessively high vessel activity. <a href="https://globalfishingwatch.org/data/ais-for-safety-and-tracking-a-brief-history/">Read more</a></p>

<p><strong>Computer vision challenge:</strong> Fighting illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing with machine learning.</p>
<p>Many vessels engaged in IUU fishing and other criminal activity turn off their automatic identification system to evade detection. The xView3 Challenge is a global call for skilled developers to submit machine learning algorithms capable of automatically detecting and characterizing these &quot;dark vessels&quot; in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite imagery. We have developed the largest publicly available SAR dataset for training machine learning models. <a href="https://iuu.xview.us/">Checkout the challenge</a></p>

<p><strong>Ice sheet mass change:</strong> Integration of 16+ years of satellite laser altimetry measurements over Antarctica and Greenland.</p>
<p>State-of-the-art ice-sheet surface elevation change for Antarctica and Greenland since 2003, estimated from two NASA satellite laser altimetry missions (ICESat, 2003-2009; and ICESat-2, 2018-present). These very precise laser measurements allows us to study decadal and multi-decadal trends at unprecedented spatial resolution; providing an invaluable dataset for advancing ice-sheet data assimilation efforts into climate models and for disentangling the causal mechanisms responsible for ice-sheet mass change and consequent sea-level rise. <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/04/29/science.aaz5845">Checkout the paper in Science</a></p>

<p><strong>Ice sheet flow:</strong> NASA MEaSUREs Inter-mission Time Series of Land Ice Velocity and Elevation (ITS_LIVE).</p>
<p>We will accelerate ice sheet and glacier change research by producing a globally-comprehensive and temporally dense multi-sensor record of land ice and ice shelf velocity and elevation, updated in near-real time as new data become available. Such a record is not presently available to the community, slowing scientific discovery from these information-rich data streams. <a href="https://its-live.jpl.nasa.gov/">Checkout the project</a></p>

<p><strong>Ice shelf dynamics:</strong> Instantaneous Antarctic ice sheet mass loss driven by thinning ice shelves.</p>
<p>Confined ice shelves restrain the flow of upstream ice streams and glaciers. Thinning of ice shelves increases the longitudinal stress and with it the spreading rate at the grounding line (GL). This effect transmits some distance upstream, and the net results is an increase in ice flux across the GL. (a) Ice shelf thickness (H) and ice flow prior to onset of ice shelf thinning. (b) Onset of ice shelf thinning (thickness loss in red) reduces buttressing and increases both longitudinal spreading and ice flux across the GL, speeding up glacier discharge into the ocean. <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2019GL085027">Checkout the paper in GRL</a></p>

<p><strong>ICESat-2 laser mission:</strong> NASA Ice, Cloud and Elevation Satellite 2.</p>
<p>The ICESat-2 will measure the height of a changing Earth, one laser pulse at a time, 10,000 laser pulses a second. Launched September 15, 2018, ICESat-2 carries a photon-counting laser altimeter that will allow scientists to measure the elevation of ice sheets, glaciers, sea ice and more - all in unprecedented detail. Our planet's frozen and icy areas, called the cryosphere, are a key focus of NASA's Earth science research. ICESat-2 will help scientists investigate why, and how much, our cryosphere is changing in a warming climate. The satellite will also measure heights across Earth's temperate and tropical regions, and take stock of the vegetation in forests worldwide. <a href="https://icesat-2.gsfc.nasa.gov/">Read more</a></p>

<p><strong>Laser &amp; radar satellites:</strong> Multi-sensor analyses of Antarctic ice shelf response to climate variability.</p>
<p>Developing a detailed history of Antarctic ice-shelf mass and stress changes on seasonal-to-interannual time scales and small spatial scales; improve our understanding of the environmental processes that cause these changes; and assess whether proxies for variability of the ice-shelf mass budget can be obtained from coarse-grid global climate models (GCMs). Our main data sources for this study are: ICESat laser altimeter data (2003-2009); Operation IceBridge (OIB) airborne laser altimeter and radio echo sounding (RES) ice thickness data (2009-present); CryoSat-2 radar altimeter (RA) data (2010-present); and European Space Agency (ESA) RA satellites ERS-1, ERS-2 and Envisat (1992-2012).</p>

**Radar response analysis:** Large-scale analysis and statistical modeling applied to Earth observations.

Estimated radar extinction coefficient (ke) over the Antarctic Ice Sheet. Values of ke shown are the averages from all ERS-1 Phase C (May 1992 to December 1993) ocean-mode waveforms acquired over the ice sheet, derived using a surface/volume retracking algorithm (Davis & Moore, 1993). Note that ke (which is inversely related to the penetration depth) is generally higher over the ice shelves than on the interior plateau. [Checkout my PhD Dissertation](http://fspaolo.net/work/phd/)

<p>Eighteen years of changes in the Antarctic ice shelves. Color map is rate of thickness change, circles are percentage thickness gained or lost, time series are mean ice-volume change over 18 years. There is considerable variability in the height-change signal, and trends on short time intervals are not representative of the underlying decadal trends. <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/348/6232/327.abstract">Checkout the paper in Science</a></p>
