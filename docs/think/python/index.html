<li>Beautiful is better than ugly.</li>
<li>Explicit is better than implicit.</li>
<li>Simple is better than complex.</li>
<li>Complex is better than complicated.</li>
<li>Flat is better than nested.</li>
<li>Sparse is better than dense.</li>
<li>Readability counts.</li>
<li>Special cases aren&rsquo;t special enough to break the rules.</li>
<li>Although practicality beats purity.</li>
<li>Errors should never pass silently.</li>
<li>Unless explicitly silenced.</li>
<li>In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.</li>
<li>There should be one &mdash; and preferably only one &mdash; obvious way to do it.</li>
<li>Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you&rsquo;re Dutch.</li>
<li>Now is better than never.</li>
<li>Although never is often better than <em>right</em> now.</li>
<li>If the implementation is hard to explain, it&rsquo;s a bad idea.</li>
<li>If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.</li>
<li>Namespaces are one honking great idea - let&rsquo;s do more of those!<br /></li>
