    The investment of societies

</div>

            <div class="markdown">
                <blockquote>
<p>No society wants you to become wise: it is against the investment of all societies. If people are wise, they cannot be exploited. If they are intelligent, they cannot be subjugated, they cannot be forced into a mechanical life, to live like robots. They will assert themselves &mdash; they will assert their individuality. They will have the fragrance of rebellion around them; they will want to live in freedom.</p>

<p>Freedom comes with wisdom, intrinsically. They are inseparable, and no society wants people to be free. The communist society, the fascist society, the capitalist society, the Hindu, the Mohammedan, the Christian &mdash; no society likes people to use their own intelligence, because the moment they start using their intelligence they become dangerous &mdash; dangerous to the establishment, dangerous to the people who are in power, dangerous to the &ldquo;haves&rdquo;; dangerous to all kinds of oppression, exploitation, suppression; dangerous to the churches, dangerous to the states, dangerous to the nations.</p>

<p>In fact, a wise man is afire, alive, aflame. He would like rather to die than to be enslaved.</p>
