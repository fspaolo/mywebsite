<p>I have thought a lot about that. I spent over ten years in solitary, in a hole. Plenty of time to think&hellip; I spent seven years without one book! That left me time to think. And this is what I discovered: Either you&rsquo;re happy with very little, free of all that extra luggage, because you have happiness inside, or you don&rsquo;t get anywhere! I am not advocating poverty. I am advocating sobriety. But since we have invented a consumer society, the economy must constantly grow. If it fails to increase it&rsquo;s a tragedy. We have invented a mountain of superfluous needs. Shopping for new, discarding the old&hellip; What we are spending is life time! Because when I buy something, when you buy something, you&rsquo;re not paying money for it. You are paying with the hours of life you had to spend earning that money. The difference is that life is one thing money can&rsquo;t buy. Life only gets shorter. And it is pitiful to waist one&rsquo;s life and freedom that way.</p>
