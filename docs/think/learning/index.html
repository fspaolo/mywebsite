<blockquote>
<p>At fifteen, I set my heart on learning.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
At thirty, I was firmly established.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
At forty, I had no more doubts.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
At fifty, I knew the will of heaven.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
At sixty, I was ready to listen to it.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
At seventy, I could follow my heart&rsquo;s desire without transgressing what was right.<br />
