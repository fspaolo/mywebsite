<p>There is no path to happiness: happiness is the path<br />
&mdash; Gautama Buddha, around 500 BC<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Of all forms of caution, caution in love is perhaps the most fatal to true happiness<br />
&mdash; Bertrand Russell, early 1800s<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Happiness is the feeling that power increases &ndash; that resistance is being overcome<br />
&mdash; Friedrich Nietzsche, late-19th century<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The secret of happiness, you see, is not found in seeking more, but in developing the capacity to enjoy less<br />
&mdash; Socrates, around 450 BC<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The man who makes everything that leads to happiness depends upon himself, and not upon other men, has adopted the very best plan for living happily<br />
&mdash; Plato, 4th century BC<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Happiness depends upon ourselves<br />
&mdash; Aristotle, around 300 BC<br />
&nbsp;<br />
 I have learned to seek my happiness by limiting my desires, rather than in attempting to satisfy them<br />
&mdash; John Stuart Mill, born in 1806<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The more man meditates upon good thoughts, the better will be his world and the world at large<br />
&mdash; Confucius, around 500 BC<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The greatest blessings of mankind are within us and within our reach. A wise man is content with his lot, whatever it may be, without wishing for what he has not<br />
&mdash; Seneca, born in 4 BC<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If you are depressed you are living in the past. If you are anxious you are living in the future. If you are at peace you are living in the present<br />
&mdash; Lao Tzu, around 600 BC<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The myriad things are complete in us. There is no greater joy than to reflect on ourselves and become sincere<br />
&mdash; Mencius, around 350 BC<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Life is not a problem to be solved but a reality to be experienced<br />
&mdash; Soren Kierkegaard, early 19th-century<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Happiness is like a butterfly; the more you chase it, the more it will elude you, but if you turn your attention to other things, it will come and sit softly on your shoulder<br />
&mdash; Henry David Thoreau, born in 1817<br />
&nbsp;<br />
You will never be happy if you continue to search for what happiness consists of. You will never live if you are looking for the meaning of life<br />
&mdash; Albert Camus, born in 1913<br />
&nbsp;<br />
By pleasure we mean the absence of pain in the body and trouble in the soul&hellip; It is&hellip; sober reasoning, searching out the grounds of choice and avoidance, and banishing those beliefs that lead to the tumult of the soul<br />
&mdash; Epicurus, 341 BC<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Self-knowledge is no guarantee of happiness, but it is on the side of happiness and can supply the courage to fight for it<br />
&mdash; Simone de Beauvoir, born 1908</p>
