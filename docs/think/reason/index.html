<blockquote>
<p>It should never stand as argument the authority of any man, regardless of how excellent and illustrious he is&hellip; it is grossly unfair to fold one&rsquo;s own feeling to a submissive reverence toward another; it is worthy of mercenaries or slaves and contrary to the dignity of human freedom to suppress oneself and to be submissive; it is supreme stupidity to believe by inveterate custom; it is an irrational thing to conform with an opinion because of the number of those who have it&hellip; it has to be sought, instead, always a reason, true and necessary&hellip; and listen to the voice of nature.<br />

</blockquote>

<p>Bruno is ahead in this way — and perhaps contributes to inspire — the demand expressed later by Bacon to purify the mind of preconceived ideas, which become an arbitrary prevention to the faithful understanding of nature, that should be achieved through compliance with the objective conditions and not with the subjective. Indeed says Bruno strongly that nature should be law to human reason, and not this one to the former.</p>
