<h2>Setup</h2>
<pre><code class="language-shell">$ npm i
</code></pre>
<h2>Commands</h2>
<h3>Develop</h3>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ npm run watch
</code></pre>
<h3>Build</h3>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ npm run build
</code></pre>
<p>Or build production ready assets:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ npm run build-prod
</code></pre>
<p>There are also a slew of individual commands to run individual build processes such as styles, scripts, etc.</p>
<h2>Netlify</h2>
<p>First, enable your airleventy fork on Netlify's interface.</p>
<p>When prompted, clear the <code>build</code> and <code>publish</code> fields (that's what your <code>netlify.toml</code> is for). Then set your deploy branch (e.g., <code>main</code>).</p>
<p>Now each time you push to your deploy branch you'll also deploy your most recent changes. ðŸŽ‰</p>
<h2>JavaScript</h2>
<p>Adding JS is pretty straightforward, but has prescriptions on file structure &amp; naming:</p>
<ul>
<li>All JS is processed through rollup with a basic Babel configuration using <code>preset-env</code>. Configure this and the accompanying <code>.browserslistrc</code> as you please.</li>
<li>Any JS file <em>without</em> an underscore prefix is treated as an asset (included in file output). Its file path is mirrored in the output.</li>
<li>Any JS file <em>with</em> an underscore prefix is treated as a non-asset module (no output file).</li>
</ul>
