  <p class="post-summary">Climate Variability and Ice-shelf Change Investigating how the Antarctic ice shelves respond to climate variability such as El NinÃÉo/Southern Oscillation.
Satellite observations over the past two decades have revealed increasing loss of grounded ice in West Antarctica, associated with floating ice shelves that have been thinning. Thinning reduces an ice shelf‚Äôs ability to restrain grounded-ice discharge, yet our understanding of the climate processes that drive mass changes is limited. Here, we use ice-shelf height data from four satellite altimeter missions (1994‚Äì2017) to show a direct link between ice-shelf height variability in the Antarctic Pacific sector and changes in regional atmospheric circulation driven by the El NinÃÉo/Southern Oscillation....</p>

  <p class="post-summary">Satellite altimetry and shipborne gravimetry on the integrated representation of the gravity field along the Brazilian coast Abstract. The integration of satellite altimetry data with shipborne gravity surveys has proven essential for the accurate determination of the gravity field over the ocean. This approach has been used extensively due to the high density and availability of data derived from space-borne sensors. Currently, an open problem is the representation of the gravity field elements with high resolution along coastal regions, where the altimeter measurement suffers from degradation due to increased variability in sea-surface height and the presence of the coastline....</p>

  <p class="post-summary">Interannual and decadal variations of Antarctic ice shelves using multi-mission satellite radar altimetry, and links with oceanic and atmospheric forcings Abstract. Antarctica‚Äôs ice shelves, the floating extensions of the ice sheet, exert an important dynamic constraint on the flow of ice from the grounded ice sheet to the ocean, and hence on changes in global sea level. Thinning of an ice shelf reduces its ability to restrain the ice discharge from the grounded ice-sheet interior....</p>

  </header>
  <p class="post-summary">Traditional indicators of noncompetitive performance still apply: corruption (the most seductive activity humans can consummate while clothed); the absence of sound, equitably enforced laws; civil strife; or government attempts to overmanage a national economy. As change has internationalized and accelerated, however, new predictive tools have emerged. They are as simple as they are fundamental, and they are rooted in culture. The greater the degree to which a state ‚Äî or an entire civilization ‚Äî succumbs to these ‚Äúseven deadly sins‚Äù of collective behavior, the more likely that entity is to fail to progress or even to maintain its position in the struggle for a share of the world‚Äôs wealth and power....</p>
