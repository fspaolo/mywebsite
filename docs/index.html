<h1>I investigate how human use of the ocean is changing. I map human activities at sea using petabytes of satellite data and artificial neural networks to build a picture of what is being done in the ocean, where and by whom_</h1>

<p>My research has appeared in top journals such as <i>Science</i> and <i>Nature</i>, and contributed to the IPCC Report. My work has been featured in major national and international news outlets, such as The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, TIME Magazine, The Economist, BBC and CNN.<p>
