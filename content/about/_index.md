## Short bio

I first became interested in polar research during my undergraduate years while participating in an expedition to Antarctica for over a month. Seeking a multidisciplinary Earth Science education I studied Oceanography at the University of Sao Paulo, Brazil, where I had the opportunity to participate in several scientific cruises in the South Atlantic Ocean. During my Masters in Geophysics I gained experience in space geodesy, combining measurements from satellite altimetry and shipborne gravimetry to improve the derivation of the Earth's gravity field using inverse methods. I then moved to California/USA, where I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Geophysics from the University of California, San Diego. During my doctoral work, I developed statistical methods and change-detection algorithms to quantify trends and variability in the volume of the Antarctic Ice Sheet using multi-mission satellite (radar and laser) data. I currently work at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory / Caltech, where I use high-performance computing to integrate and analyze over 25 years of satellite and airborne measurements of the height and velocity of the ice over Greenland and Antarctictica, with the goal of understanding the ice-climate interaction and improving sea-level projections for the next century ;)

## About this site

I started this site as a place to keep information, source code and documentation available on the web (mostly for myself). Feel free to grab and modify anything you may find useful (for some inconceivable reason).

These pages were created with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and the [Cocoa](https://github.com/nishanths/cocoa-hugo-theme) theme.


## Why a minimal design?

In a visually striking and polluted world, a minimalistic layout recovers the beauty of simplicity and sophistication. The aesthetics of modern design is clean and focuses on the contents' essential, reducing the (usually complex) subject to its fundamental features, and nothing more...

> In anything at all, perfection is finally attained not when there is no longer anything to add, but when there is no longer anything to take away, when a body has been stripped down to its nakedness.  
--- Antoine de Saint ExupÃ©ry  


> The public is more familiar with bad design than good design. It is, in effect, conditioned to prefer bad design, because that is what it lives with. The new becomes threatening, the old reassuring.  
--- Paul Rand
