Hi! I'm [Fernando Paolo](https://science.jpl.nasa.gov/people/Serrano%20Paolo/), a postdoctoral scholar @ [NASA](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/) Jet Propulsion Lab, Caltech. I [develop](https://github.com/fspaolo) algorithms for remote-sensing applications and large-scale [data analysis](https://www.sdsc.edu/News%20Items/PR20150420_antarctic_ice.html) to study the Earth’s changing [climate](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2015/03/25/science.aaa0940).

## Short Bio

I work at NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab. I use high-performance computing to process and analyze nearly 30 years of ice sheet elevation and velocity measurements, derived from multiple satellites and airborne campaigns, with the goal of understanding ice-climate interactions and improving sea-level projections over the next century.

Before that, I got my PhD in Geophysics from the University of California, San Diego, where I developed statistical methods for satellite data fusion and change detection to analyze trends and variability on the Antarctic ice sheet mass. 

Before that, I got my MS in Geophysics working with space geodesy, combining measurements from satellites and ships to improve the derivation of the Earth's gravity field using inverse methods. 

Before that, I got interested in climate science during my undergraduate years while participating in an expedition to Antarctica for over a month. I studied Oceanography at the University of Sao Paulo, Brazil, participating in several scientific cruises in the South Atlantic Ocean.

## Professional Biosketch

Fernando Paolo is a Postdoctoral Scholar at JPL/Caltech. He studies the role of the cryosphere in the Earth's climate system and its implication on future sea-level change. Fernando uses a variety of space-geodetic techniques, such as radar and laser satellite altimeters as well as satellite imagery, to quantify current ice sheet change. Fernando's interests include the development of novel approaches for the synthesis and analysis of large-scale remote-sensing data.


## About this site

I started this site as a place to keep information, source code and documentation available on the web (mostly for myself). Feel free to grab and modify anything you may find useful.


## Why a minimal design?

In a visually striking and polluted world, a minimalistic layout recovers the beauty of simplicity and sophistication. The aesthetics of modern design is clean and focuses on the contents' essential, reducing the subject to its fundamental features, and nothing more...

> In anything at all, perfection is finally attained not when there is no longer anything to add, but when there is no longer anything to take away, when a body has been stripped down to its nakedness. --Antoine de Saint Exupéry

> The public is more familiar with bad design than good design. It is, in effect, conditioned to prefer bad design, because that is what it lives with. The new becomes threatening, the old reassuring.  --Paul Rand
