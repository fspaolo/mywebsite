> Here's to the crazy ones.  
> &nbsp;  
> The misfits.  
> &nbsp;  
> The rebels.  
> &nbsp;  
> The troublemakers.  
> &nbsp;  
> The round pegs in the square holes.  
> &nbsp;  
> The ones who see things differently.  
> &nbsp;  
> They're not fond of rules.  
> &nbsp;  
> And they have no respect for the status quo.  
> &nbsp;  
> You can quote them, disagree with them,  
> &nbsp;  
> glorify or vilify them.  
> &nbsp;  
> About the only thing you can't do is ignore them.  
> &nbsp;  
> Because they change things.  
> &nbsp;  
> They push the human race forward.  
> &nbsp;  
> While some may see them as the crazy ones,  
> &nbsp;  
> we see genius.  
> &nbsp;  
> Because the people who are crazy enough to think  
> &nbsp;  
> they can change the world, are the ones who do.
