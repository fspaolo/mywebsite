> May I be a guard for those who need protection  
> &nbsp;  
> A guide for those on the path  
> &nbsp;  
> A boat, a raft, a bridge for those who wish to cross the flood  
> &nbsp;  
> May I be a lamp in the darkness  
> &nbsp;  
> A resting place for the weary  
> &nbsp;  
> A healing medicine for all who are sick  
> &nbsp;  
> A vase of plenty, a tree of miracles  
> &nbsp;  
> And for the boundless multitudes of living beings  
> &nbsp;  
> May I bring sustenance and awakening  
> &nbsp;  
> Enduring like the earth and sky  
> &nbsp;  
> Until all beings are freed from sorrow  
> &nbsp;  
> And all are awakened.  
> &nbsp;
