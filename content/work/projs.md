## MEaSUREs ITS-LIVE 

*Inter-mission Time Series of Land Ice Velocity and Elevation (ITS-LIVE)*

We will accelerate ice sheet and glacier change research by producing a globally-comprehensive and temporally dense multi-sensor record of land ice and ice shelf velocity and elevation, updated in near-real time as new data become available. Such a record is not presently available to the community, slowing scientific discovery from these information-rich data streams.

PI: Gardner (JPL), Co-I's: Agram, Hua, Linick, Nilsson, Paolo, Walker (JPL), Scambos (U.Colorado), Fahnestock, Meyer (U.Alaska), $4.2M, 2018--2023.
